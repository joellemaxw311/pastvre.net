## Welcome to Pastvre!

My name is Joelle, also known as MooCovv (like MooCow, but with 'vv' instead of 'w') on the internet. I call my domain "Pastvre" (Pasture, but with 'v' instead of 'u') to match my bovine theme. My pronouns are she/her/hers.

This is my personal website, where I share my projects and interests. This is also my sandbox for learning to use Jekyll with GitHub pages.
